## Glad to see you here! 

I'm a computer science student, passionate about technology in general, addicted (just a little) to coffee ☕

I've started my jorney into the great world of computing 'cause I really wanted to learn how to develop and program games, but as I delved deeper into programming subjects, I became completely in love with everything, today, I learn a little about each area


## Talking about Personal Stuff:
- 🔧 I'm currently working on SigaSul, 
- 📖 I'm currently studying at UNOESC, on the Computer Science course
- 💬 Ask me anything [here](https://github.com/Katun0) I am happy to help.
- 🤔 Fun fact: Equal is Not Always Equal in JS.
