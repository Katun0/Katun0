## Glad to see you here! 

I'm a computer science student, passionate about technology in general, addicted (just a little) to coffee â˜•

I've started my jorney into the great world of computing 'cause I really wanted to learn how to develop and program games, but as I delved deeper into programming subjects, I became completely in love with everything, today, I learn a little about each area
